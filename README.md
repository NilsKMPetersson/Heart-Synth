# Heart-Synth
A synthesizer/sequencer that is triggered by the user’s heartbeat!

NOTE: This project requires additional components such as Arduino and photosensitive heart-monitor. 

I decided to create a synthesizer/sequencer that is triggered by the user’s heartbeat. All the user has to do is put on the heart monitor on their little finger, raise the threshold knob until they hear a sound, and then it will start to play through a pre-decided sequence of notes, playing a note every time the heart monitor senses a heartbeat. Four LEDs will also light up, indicating the position of the sequence of notes. There is also a volume knob and an audio-out jack.
